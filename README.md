# Story of My first Love
"B.M"
The Day I saw you for the first time, that very moment I lost my consciousness!
For you I say, “Study me as much as you like, you will not know me, for I differ in a hundred ways from what you see me to be. Put yourself behind my eyes and see me as I see myself, for I have chosen to dwell in a place you cannot see.”
